<p>Currently there isn't a <a href="https://www.python.org">python</a> user group in Mombasa, Kenya. <a href="https://twitter.com/bmwasaru">Britone Mwasaru</a> is starting a technology community in <a href="https://www.tum.ac.ke">Technical University of Mombasa</a>. For the students that are planning to venture into programming will be introduced to python. Planned launch date on Friday 8th November at 2p.m EAT.</p>

<p>Python is a language that is easy to learn therefore a good introductory language especially to the first year students. This is to show how fun and easy programming can be hence get rid of the fear of programming.</p>

<p>Cheers to a journey of self discovery :)</p>

<p>Despite the timings problems, we posted the posters 4 hours to the event, the attendance was surprisingly good. </p>

<ul>
<li>Started with the <a href="https://www.code.org">code.org</a> video on learning how to code so as to create the sense that programming is not difficult. </li>
<li>We explained why we were using python and examples of companies using python. We did installation of python on windows (a large number had windows Operating System). </li>
<li>It was a hand ons session, they followed along with me. In case of any problem they had the freedom to shout and interrupt me. </li>
<li>We discussed how to use the python terminal and the IDLE. Explained to reasons to find a better editor for python.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.twitter.com/bmwasaru">Britone</a> did a demo of web application that he is working on. He explained the Django python web framework. </li>
</ul><p>The attendees exclaimed that they previously thought that programming was hard but after the session believed that programming is not that hard. One gentleman asked about how to use python to build control systems. It was explained to him that there are open source libraries such as SciPy and NumPy that would be of use to him. Another asked how he can use python for networking, he was answered that there are libraries such as Twisted that would be of help to him. </p>

<p>Finally, we discussed about the Mombasa Technology Community and how they can get involved. The fellow students were encouraged to collaborate and learn from each other.</p>
